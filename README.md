# Parking-Permit-Kiosk

  Our goal for this assignment is to create a Java application for a Parking Permit Kiosk. Our Parking Permit Kiosk is a system for use on the campus of York University to issue vehicle parking permits to students. Like most kiosks, interaction is via a touch screen. The system’s keyboard is not used. For this assignment, we’ll use point-and-click operations with the mouse to simulate a touch screen.
